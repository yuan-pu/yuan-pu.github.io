Hello, welcome to my home page!

I‚Äôm Yuan Pu (Êµ¶Â™õ), a Postgraduate Research Assistant at the Yale School of Medicine, working under the mentorship of Dr. [Dennis Shung](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/dennis-shung/). I graduated magna cum laude from Brown University in 2023 with a B.S. in Computational Biology, where I completed my honors thesis under the guidance of Dr. [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/). 

I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging machine learning, particularly deep learning, as a tool to explore and address biological and biomedical questions.
