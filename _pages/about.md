Hello, welcome to my home page!

I'm Yuan Pu (Êµ¶Â™õ), an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Duke University. My research is focused on developing AI and machine learning methods to address critical problems in healthcare.

Previously, I worked as a Postgraduate Associate at Yale School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. [Dennis Shung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-LePdMAAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated magna cum laude from Brown University in 2023 with a B.S. in Computational Biology, where I completed my honors thesis under the guidance of Dr. [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/).
