I’m Yuan Pu (浦媛), a Postgraduate Research Assistant at the Yale School of Medicine, working under the mentorship of Dr. [Dennis Shung](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/dennis-shung/). I graduated magna cum laude from Brown University in 2023 with a B.S. in Computational Biology, where I completed my honors thesis under the guidance of Dr. [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/). I’m passionate about leveraging machine learning, particularly deep learning, as a tool to explore and address biological and biomedical questions.
