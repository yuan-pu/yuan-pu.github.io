abstract = {Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical decision support systems (CDSS) poses a socio-technological challenge that is impacted by usability, trust, and human-computer interaction (HCI). AI-CDSS interventions have shown limited benefit in clinical outcomes, which may be due to insufficient understanding of how health-care providers interact with AI systems. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance AI-CDSS, but haven’t been studied in either simulated or real-world clinical scenarios. We present findings from a randomized controlled trial deploying AI-CDSS for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with and without an LLM interface within realistic clinical simulations for physician and medical student participants. We find evidence that LLM augmentation improves ease-of-use, that LLM-generated responses with citations improve trust, and HCI varies based on clinical expertise. Qualitative themes from interviews suggest the perception of LLM-augmented AI-CDSS as a team-member used to confirm initial clinical intuitions and help evaluate borderline decisions.},

    abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.},

	abstract = {Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) is a testicular germ cell toxicant that selectively targets spermatocytes. In rats, male-only EGME exposure reduces mating success and can lead to an increase in resorbed fetuses. In a previous study, five-day exposure to 50, 60, or 75 mg/kg/d EGME in male rats led to a decrease in sperm motility and increase in retained spermatid heads with a LOAEL of 75 mg/kg/d. At 60 mg/kg/d, EGME exposure altered the proportion of sperm small RNA reads mapped to different small RNA categories and the distribution of read lengths. Because there is evidence that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in sperm regulate embryonic development, we analyzed sperm sncRNA data from EGME-treated male rats to identify differential expression at the individual RNA level. EGME treatment resulted in dose-dependent increases in the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs), piRNAs, and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). We identified 12 miRNAs that were differentially expressed at all EGME doses, with a monotonic, dose-dependent increase. High-confidence targets of these 12 miRNAs are known to be expressed in pre-implantation embryos and statistically enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes related to early development, such as cell fate commitment and regulation of developmental growth. These results demonstrated that the EGME-induced changes in sperm sncRNA levels were reproducible, dose-dependent, and provided a putative mechanism of paternal EGME effects on embryonic development, which will be investigated in future studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.National Institute of General Medical Sciences, https://ror.org/04q48ey07, P20 GM109035, P20 GM156712Brown University, https://ror.org/05gq02987},
